This repository is primarily a working space for our first steps in the Firefox OS world.
The exercise consists in developping a complete application running on Firefox phones.

BAAS (BarCode As A Service) is a Google Application, running on the Google App Engine (GAE).
It was chosen as a base for our work,
This proves furthermore that GAE's application is fully doable for running as a
packaged Firefox application.

Hence, the directory structure here represents a mixed of GAE and FxOS, with Eclipse
settings so to allow independent development of the pure Google Application.

For the first revisions, the "number crunching" will occur on the Server
side (Google), while we will concentrate on packaging and design layout on the Client.
Computation will be migrated later on the Client side, and that implies
to elaborate complex JavaScripts, or even to add features at some OS layer.

We also plan to pursue our experience implementing Real Time Communications (WebRTC),
feeling the importance of P2P exchange in the context of mobility.

It is expected that this project evolves considerably among the time.
